          <!-- First Paragraph -->
          <p class="lead text-justify">
            I've been working on a Flappy Bird-inspired game called Batsy to
            familiarize myself with Godot, and it's been a great learning
            experience. Godot’s scene system and scripting language, GDScript,
            made implementing mechanics like procedural obstacles and item
            pooling relatively easy. Compared to other engines I've used, I
            found that scaling elements in Godot is much smoother, which was a
            big plus when setting up my game’s layout. While there were a few
            quirks to get used to, like signal management and node-based
            organization, overall, the workflow felt intuitive, and I was able
            to iterate quickly.
          </p>

          <!-- Second Paragraph with Image -->
          <p class="lead text-justify">
            For Batsy, I wanted to ensure a high-quality experience with a clean
            layout, smooth movement, and rewarding mechanics. The game isn’t
            finished yet, but I estimate it will be ready in a few more days.
            One of the cool features I implemented is object pooling for coins
            and rocks to optimize performance, so instead of constantly creating
            and destroying objects, the game reuses them when needed. This
            prevents unnecessary lag and improves efficiency, especially as the
            game speeds up. I also tweaked the spawning logic to ensure a fair
            but challenging experience—coins appear in varied, non-repetitive
            patterns, and obstacles are spaced intelligently to avoid impossible
            scenarios.

          <!-- Third Paragraph -->
          <p class="lead text-justify">
            Another interesting addition was dynamic difficulty scaling—the game 
            gradually increases in speed, forcing players to react faster as they 
            progress. To make the world feel more alive, I included smooth scrolling 
            ground and randomized rock placements, ensuring no two playthroughs feel 
            exactly the same. Collecting coins adds to a persistent total, which I 
            plan to expand with unlockable skins or power-ups in the future. With 
            just a few more refinements, Batsy will be polished and ready to go, 
            and I’m excited to see how it turns out!
