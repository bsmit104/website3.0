        <!-- First Paragraph -->
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          Good design is fundamentally about creating intuitive and engaging experiences for users. 
          One of my professors, Tyler Coleman, described this concept as the "juice" of a game—the 
          small, thoughtful details that add polish and bring a project to life. These might include 
          subtle animations, responsive hover effects, or smooth transitions that make an interface 
          feel fluid and dynamic. While the term originates from game design, it applies equally 
          well to any form of digital media. Juice reflects a creator’s attention to detail and 
          effort to elevate a project beyond functionality, making it memorable and enjoyable to 
          interact with.

        <!-- Second Paragraph with Image -->
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          Documentation, on the other hand, is a more complex and often overlooked challenge. 
          Effective documentation takes time and practice to master, but the results are invaluable. 
          High-quality content is essential for a compelling portfolio. Poor documentation—like 
          capturing dimly lit gameplay footage of Skyrim with glitches and uninspired dialogue—fails 
          to convey the strengths of a project. In contrast, a well-curated Pac-Man highlight reel 
          with clear and exciting visuals leaves a lasting impression. I’ve struggled with this myself, 
          having neglected to collect strong visuals and clips for past projects. Going forward, I 
          plan to prioritize documenting my work consistently, capturing images and videos as I 
          progress. This past year, I did focus on written documentation to track my learning, and 
          it’s already proven to be a powerful resource for revisiting and applying past knowledge.

          I’ve also come to believe that improvement is an ongoing process. Growing up, I spent 
          countless hours painting and creating with friends, and I realized that no artwork is 
          ever truly complete. There’s always an opportunity to add depth or refine details. This 
          perspective drives my approach to digital media; a constant commitment to refinement can 
          be seen and felt by anyone who interacts with the work. I’m dedicating time each week to 
          improving my portfolio, aiming to strike a balance between compelling content and thoughtful 
          design. Incorporating user feedback and studying others’ portfolios will further guide my 
          progress. This iterative process ensures that every project I create reflects both the care 
          and the creativity I bring to my work.
