        <p class="lead text-justify">
          The maze generation script uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to carve paths into a grid 
          initially filled with walls, ensuring paths are precisely one cell wide. Starting at a designated 
          cell (1, 1), the algorithm explores random directions, carving two-cell-wide paths and marking the 
          intervening walls as part of the path while maintaining surrounding walls. Dead ends are resolved 
          through backtracking using a stack until all reachable cells are visited. An entrance at (1, 0) 
          and an exit at (height-2, width-1) are manually carved after the maze is generated, creating a 
          solvable maze with clear entry and exit points. The maze is then saved as a Portable Pixmap (PPM) 
          file, where walls are represented in black (0 0 0) and paths in white (255 255 255), allowing for 
          easy visualization in image viewers. The script ensures odd dimensions for proper maze structure, 
          and its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent tool for experimenting with procedural 
          generation or learning algorithms.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">RSA File Encryption</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          RSA cryptography is a fundamental algorithm for secure data communication, relying on 
          large prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and number theory. This implementation, written 
          in C with the GNU MP (GMP) library for handling large integers, encompasses key generation, 
          encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. The key generation process involves creating 
          two large primes (p and q), calculating their product (n) as the modulus, and determining 𝜙(𝑛)ϕ(n) for 
          selecting a public exponent e that is coprime to 𝜙
          (𝑛)ϕ(n). Using the modular inverse, the private key d is derived. File-based functions securely store 
          and retrieve keys, while modular exponentiation powers encryption (𝑐=𝑚𝑒mod  𝑛c=m e modn) and decryption (𝑚=𝑐𝑑mod  𝑛m=c d modn) 
          processes. Block-based encryption and decryption ensure efficient handling of large messages, with dynamic sizing based on the modulus.
          Digital signatures enhance security by verifying authenticity. A message signed with a private key is validated by checking its 
          integrity against the public key.

      Key mathematical operations, such as GCD calculation for ensuring e is valid and modular inverse

        serves as a practical exploration of cryptographic principles, offering a robust and modular approach to securing data.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Multithreaded Password Cracker</h2>
    <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          This code represents a parallelized password-cracking system that uses 
          multiple servers to efficiently guess passwords encrypted with cryptographic 
          hashes. The system utilizes both TCP and UDP protocols for communication 
          between servers, with a focus on splitting the password cracking task 
          across different nodes. The main function, depending on the host's 
          identity (either "noggin," "thor," "nogbad," or "olaf"), orchestrates 
          the distribution of password-cracking tasks. Each server attempts to crack 
          different parts of the password space using a combination of multi-threading 
          (via std::thread) and brute force. The password hash comparison is done by 
          generating hash values for all possible combinations from a predefined character 
          set and comparing them with the target hash. Upon success, the cracked passwords 
          are sent back to the main server, where they are compiled into a final message.
          The system uses multicast UDP for receiving encrypted password hashes, which 
          are distributed across the servers for cracking. The crackerjack function manages 
          this process by spawning threads to break down the task into smaller chunks, 
          leveraging the computational power of each server. Once each server has attempted 
          its portion of the task, the results are communicated back to the main server via 
          UDP. The passwords that were successfully cracked on the secondary servers are collected 
          and integrated into the main result set. The use of parallel processing through 
          threading and distributed computing across multiple machines accelerates the 
          password-cracking process, making the system scalable and efficient.
